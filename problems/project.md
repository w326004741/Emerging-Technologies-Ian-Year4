# Project 2017
The following are your instructions to complete the project for the module [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io) for 2017.
This project is worth [40% of your marks for the module](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/#assessment-information).
Please see the [course homepage for the deadline](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/#submit-ca).

## Overview
In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images.
Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image.
You should use [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to do this.
Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.

## Instructions
1. Create a git repository with a README.md and an appropriate gitignore file. The README should explain who you are, why you created the application, how you created it, how to download and run it, and summarise any references you have used.
2. In the repository, create a web application that serves a HTML page as the root resource. The page should contain an input where the user can upload (or draw) an image containing a digit, and an area to display the image and the digit.
3. Add a route to your application that accepts requests containing a user input image and responds with the digit.
4. Connect the HTML page to the route using AJAX.

## Submission
To submit your project, you must make your git repository available using a git hosting service like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
Use the [submission link on the course webpage](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/#submit-ca) to submit the URL for your hosted repository.
You can submit at any time before the deadline, the earlier the better, as the last commit you make to the repository before the deadline will be corrected irrespective of when you submitted your link.
If your repository is private you must add the lecturer as a collaborator.

## Grading 
Your project will be graded using the following rubric.

# Problem set: Tensorflow
These problems relate to the Python package [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
We will again use the famous [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository.
Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.


## 1. Use Tensorflow to create model
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.


## 2. Split the data into training and testing
Split the data set into a training set and a testing set.
You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook.
If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.


## 3. Train the model
Use the testing set to train your model.


## 4. Test the model
Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
